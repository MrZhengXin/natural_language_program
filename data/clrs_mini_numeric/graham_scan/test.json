{"input": "Execute the instructions step by step. Do not jump steps. Do not stop before completion. When reading or updating an array at some index, use concrete values rather than just variables.\n\nInitial: \nYou are given arrays `xs` and `ys` of length N, representing x and y coordinates of points.\n- xs: xs[0] = 14.83, xs[1] = 6.72, xs[2] = 0.91, xs[3] = 5.62, xs[4] = 4.8, xs[5] = 19.06, xs[6] = 7.04, xs[7] = 5.76, xs[8] = 7.18, xs[9] = 18.94, N = 10.\n- ys: ys[0] = 12.67, ys[1] = 12.42, ys[2] = 14.31, ys[3] = 7.76, ys[4] = 8.29, ys[5] = 13.02, ys[6] = 0.03, ys[7] = 3.85, ys[8] = 6.69, ys[9] = 4.79.\n\nSet up:\n1. Initialize an array `in_hull` of length N with all values set to zero: in_hull[0] = 0, in_hull[1] = 0, in_hull[2] = 0, in_hull[3] = 0, in_hull[4] = 0, in_hull[5] = 0, in_hull[6] = 0, in_hull[7] = 0, in_hull[8] = 0, in_hull[9] = 0.\n2. Create an array `stack_prev` filled with values from 0 to N-1: stack_prev[0] = 0, stack_prev[1] = 1, stack_prev[2] = 2, stack_prev[3] = 3, stack_prev[4] = 4, stack_prev[5] = 5, stack_prev[6] = 6, stack_prev[7] = 7, stack_prev[8] = 8, stack_prev[9] = 9.\n3. Create an array `atans` of length N with all values set to zero: atans[0] = 0, atans[1] = 0, atans[2] = 0, atans[3] = 0, atans[4] = 0, atans[5] = 0, atans[6] = 0, atans[7] = 0, atans[8] = 0, atans[9] = 0.\n\nStep 1: Define a function named `counter_clockwise` that takes in three indices: i, j, and k.\n- Compute the value: `(xs[j] - xs[i]) * (ys[k] - ys[i]) - (ys[j] - ys[i]) * (xs[k] - xs[i])`.\n- Return `True` if this value is less than or equal to 0, indicating that the three points with these indices form a counter-clockwise turn or are collinear. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nStep 2: Start by setting the variable `best` to 0. \n\nStep 3: Iterate over each point by its index `i`:\n- If `ys[i]` is less than `ys[best]` OR (`ys[i]` equals `ys[best]` AND `xs[i]` is less than `xs[best]`), set `best` to i.\n\nStep 4: Set the entry `in_hull[best]` to 1, indicating that the point with index `best` is part of the convex hull.\n\nStep 5: Set the value of `last_stack` to `best`.\n\nStep 6: For every point (by its index `i`):\n- If `i` isn't the same as `best`, compute the 2-argument arctangent of the differences `ys[i] - ys[best]` (for y) and `xs[i] - xs[best]` (for x), and store it in `atans[i]`. You shall present the numeric value.\n\nAfter completing the loop for Step 6:\n- Assign a very negative placeholder value (-123456789) to `atans[best]`.\n\nStep 7: Sort the indices based on their corresponding `atans` values and store the result in the array `ind`.\n\nStep 8: Restore the value of `atans[best]` to 0.\n\nStep 9: Traverse through all points from 1 to N-1 by their index `i`:\n- If `i` is 3 or more, continuously check if points with indices `stack_prev[last_stack]`, `last_stack`, and `ind[i]` form a counter-clockwise turn using the `counter_clockwise` function.\n  - If they do, perform the following:\n    - Assign `last_stack` to `prev_last`.\n    - Update `last_stack` with the value of `stack_prev[last_stack]`.\n    - Set `stack_prev[prev_last]` to `prev_last`.\n    - Setting `in_hull[prev_last]` to 0.\n- Setting `in_hull[ind[i]]` to 1.\n- Update `stack_prev[ind[i]]` with the current value of `last_stack`.\n- Update `last_stack` with the value of `ind[i]`.\n\nStep 10: Print the array `in_hull`.\n\n-----\n\nThe computation procedure is as follows, from Step 2 to Step 10, with each line numbered sequentially (e.g., 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. etc.):\n1. Step 2, set `best` to 0.\n", "output": "in_hull[0] = 0, in_hull[1] = 0, in_hull[2] = 1, in_hull[3] = 0, in_hull[4] = 0, in_hull[5] = 1, in_hull[6] = 1, in_hull[7] = 0, in_hull[8] = 0, in_hull[9] = 1", "in_hull": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], "xs": [14.83, 6.72, 0.91, 5.62, 4.8, 19.06, 7.04, 5.76, 7.18, 18.94], "ys": [12.67, 12.42, 14.31, 7.76, 8.29, 13.02, 0.03, 3.85, 6.69, 4.79]}
